# Ludum Dare Feedback Friends

An incentive to comment on games, for Ludum Dare 36.

## How it works

This mini-site is basically a LD games browser, improved. It will use a slightly clever "comment coolness" system to feature games with the least feedback received first.

It will try to favor constructive criticism by giving more points to longer comments, and maybe detect comment spam by looking for copy/pasted comments, maybe by comparing timestamps.

## Current state

* Ludum Dare entries scraping: MOSTLY DONE
* Basic games listing: **TODO**
* Search tools: **TODO**
* Comments scoring system: **TODO**
* Good-looking theme, "feedback friends" listing and overall sugar: **TODO**
* Trophy system(?): **TODO**

## Notes

* "Feedback friends" just means other authors with whom you commented on each other's game
* Instead of ratings, I'm considering a stupid but potentially fun trophy system, that will analyze keywords in comments to give awards such as "Most WTF Entry", "Cutest Entry", "Least Playable Entry", etc.
